Usage: This blog can be viewed locally by running a jekyll server through terminal, via the command "bundle exec jekyll serve". After the command has been entered, go to localhost:4000 on any web browser. This blog can also be viewed online at https://tomjones-4.github.io/.

Design Decisions: I chose to keep the pages simple and as minimalist as possible. The fictional character I made a blog for is a freelance photographer in Portland, ME. I wanted there to be minimal text, so the user's attention would be devoted to the pictures. I tried to make the links easy to understand, so I put the link for the water series under the picture of the water, and the link for the city series under the picture of the city. I also wanted to make it as easy as possible to get back to the home page, so each of the links from the home page has a link back to the home page. The user can also do this with a back button on their browser. I thought for the blog posts (the water and city series) it would be nice to have the material centered, since they mostly consisted of pictures. I though this gave a sense of balance to the posts that was visually appealing. I wanted the text to be a little bigger in the blog posts, because there wasn't much of it. The text provides some spacing between the pictures, too.

Challenge: This assignment was very challenging for me in many ways. I don't have any web development experience other than the local site we made in class for TC1. Hosting a site online was difficult for me because I didn't have Ruby or Jekyll installed. I was very confused during the installation progress because I was repeatedly denied permission to download or install certain components that were needed to get the website online. After finally getting the environment set up, I struggled with having the online site and the local site match each other. For some reason, whenever I pushed the site changes to Github, the version that was actually pushed was much older than what I had on my local site, and I couldn't figure out why. The post format was also challenging for me, as I couldn't figure out how to get the links from my home page to blog posts to work because I was getting "404: page not found" errors. Eventually, I was able to get the links to direct to my posts, but my computer kept not recognizing the directory the posts were stored in, so I would have to recreate the directory and save the posts there again. Overall, I feel like I understand HTML and CSS a little better. I am still quite unsure of how Jekyll and Github pages work, but I have a slightly better understanding than when I started.
