<h3><p>We can think of cities as ecosystems in which both the individual and the community affect each other in positive and negative ways.</p>
<div class="img"><img src="../../../../../img/city2.jpg" alt="" style="width:400px;height:300px;"></div>
	<p>Cities represent the evolution of humans and our tendencies to live together. In cities, we are surrounded by people - friends, family, coworkers. We are always looking for ways to coexist.</p>
<div class="img"><img src="../../../../../img/city3.jpg" alt="" style="width:400px;height:300px;"></div>
	<p>Being surrounded by so many people can make us lose our sense of individuality. However, it can also cause our creative energies to flourish, as we are inspired and bewildered by the ideas of others around us.</p>
